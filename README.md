# Mood Sensor 
MoodSense is a chat-based mental health analyzer that uses NLP and emotion detection models to analyze WhatsApp chats and voice notes. In a world where people express their feelings more freely through texts than in person, this tool aims to capture and 
interpret emotional patterns to support mental well-being. 
The problem it addresses is the lack of passive, honest emotional monitoring—most tools depend on self-reporting. MoodSense offers a non-intrusive way to understand mood trends by using real conversations and presenting them through interactive dashboards. 
This project is motivated by the growing need for accessible emotional insight tools that are both intelligent and easy to use, helping people become more aware of their mental state over time. 
### Objectives of the Project 
  1. To develop a web-based emotional analysis tool that extracts and analyzes user emotions from WhatsApp chat logs and voice inputs. 
  2. To implement chat log cleaning and processing methods that filter out irrelevant or short messages and group meaningful content by date and sender. 
  3. To utilize pre-trained emotion classification models to detect both basic and specific emotional states from text and audio data. 
  4. To build a speech recognition module that allows users to submit voice logs, which are then transcribed and analyzed for emotion. 
  5. To create a conversational chatbot that responds based on the user’s mood, adding an interactive and empathetic element to the platform. 
  6. To design interactive dashboards that visualize mood trends and emotional patterns over time for better self-awareness. 
  7. To ensure the system is easy to use, requires no installation, and offers insights in a simple, intuitive format through a clean web interface.
